# 1.Basic Inheritance
# 1. Simple Inheritance
# Create a Vehicle class with a method start().
# Create a Car class that inherits from Vehicle and adds a method drive().

# 2.Inheriting Multiple Methods
# Create a Person class with methods walk() and talk().
# Create a Student class that inherits from Person and adds a method study().

# 3.Override a Method
# Create a class Bird with a method sound() that prints "Bird sound".
# Create a class Parrot that overrides sound() and prints "Parrot talks".



# class Vehicle:  #1
#     @staticmethod
#     def start():
#         print("Car started...")

#     def drive():
#         print("Now,drive the car")

# c1=Car()
# c1.drive()
# c1.start()
    

# Output

# Car started...
# Now,drive the car
